What is Tinkerer?
-----------------

Tinkerer is a blogging engine/static website generator powered by Sphinx.

It allows blogging in reStructuredText format, comes with out-of-the-box 
support for post publishing dates, authors, categories, tags, post archive,
RSS feed generation, comments powered by Disqus and more.

Tinkerer is also highly customizable through Sphinx extensions.

Why Tinkerer?
-------------

* Because *"hacker"* is way overused nowadays.
* Because static websites are cool.
* Because you already write documentation in RST format and you love it.
* Because you have Pygments for sharing highlighted code.
* Because you can use your favorite Sphinx extensions right away.
