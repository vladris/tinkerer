=====================

What's New
----------

* Tinkerer moved to GitHub! Old repositories on BitBucket are still there for
  the time being, but going forward, all development will take place on GitHub.
  Make sure to star/fork Tinkerer `here <https://github.com/vladris/tinkerer>`_
* A brand new *flat* theme optimized around distraction-free reading and a
  customized Pygments style displaying code in the
  `Solarized <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>`_ dark theme.
* A new ``conf.py`` setting, ``rss_generate_full_posts``, enabling generation
  of full posts even when using the ``readmore`` directive on the website
* Italian localization
* Other bug fixes
