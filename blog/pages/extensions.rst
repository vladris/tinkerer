Extensions
==========

Thanks to the awesome Tinkerer community, besides the built-in extensions that
come with Tinkerer, you can get an assortment of additional extensions.

Community extensions are Tinkerer extensions contributed and maintained by
various authors. They are not part of the Tinkerer distribution, but they can
be acquired separately from the
`tinkerer-contrib repository <https://github.com/vladris/tinkerer-contrib>`_.

Extensions usually go in your blog's ``_exts`` directory. Additional setup
steps are provided for each extension.
